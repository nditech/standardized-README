# Collaborator Access Guide

* **Only NDI employees have full access to NDITech's GitHub  private repos as `members` or `owners`**.
* Any outside developer / contributor / collaborator / vendor... will be invited as a collaborator to the specific repository that he or she is working on. That way, the collaborators cannot see NDI's private repositories by default.
* Collaborators will have to fork NDI's repository and make pull request to contribute code. That way, cocollaborators cannot accidentally make changes on `master branch` but still be able to fork the repository as private without having GitHub premium.

> * Collaborators can still copy the code or duplicate the repository and make the code public without NDI's permission. A non-disclosure agreement is needed for projects with sensitive data.
> * These policies will be applied for repositories created after 23rd Sep 2018 and slowly implemented for old projects.
